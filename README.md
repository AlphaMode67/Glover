CRISPER 


Crisper Games is an innovative project born out of a student's desire to bring fun to the digital world, even in environments where technology is tightly controlled. Created by a student at Patton Middle School in McMinnville, Oregon, Crisper Games is a collection of HTML-based games, music, and digital tools that work seamlessly on restricted school devices—like Chromebooks—without the need for any installations or downloads.

Because school-issued devices often come with heavy restrictions, Crisper Games was designed as a workaround to access entertainment on locked-down systems. The collection uses HTML files, ensuring that anyone with a web browser can enjoy the content—whether they're on a Chromebook, a desktop, or even a mobile device.

This collection features a variety of experiences: from nostalgic games that recall the classics to fresh and original titles that offer something unique. It’s not just about games, though—there’s music and other creative digital projects too, all designed to provide fun and entertainment regardless of the device limitations.

Crisper Games is all about making the most of what’s available, finding creative solutions in a world of restrictions. It’s a way for students, teachers, and anyone else to enjoy a little digital freedom while exploring fun and engaging content, no matter where they are.
